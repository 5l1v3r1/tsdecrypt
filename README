tsdecrypt
=========
tsdecrypt reads incoming mpeg transport stream over UDP/RTP and then
decrypts it using libdvbcsa and keys obtained from OSCAM or similar cam
server. tsdecrypt communicates with CAM server using camd35 over tcp
protocol also known as cs378x.

License
=======
tsdecrypt is released under GNU GPL v2.

Installation
============
tsdecrypt depends on two external libraries - openssl and libdvbcsa.
You probably already have openssl installed, libdvbcsa can be downloaded
from http://www.videolan.org/developers/libdvbcsa.html

Documentation
=============
tsdecrypt is controlled using command line parameters. Run tsdecrypt to
see all of the parameters and explanation what every one of them does.
For more information read the man page.

Development
===========
The development is tracked using git. The repository is hosted at github
to get it, run the following command:

   git clone git://github.com/gfto/tsdecrypt.git
   git submodule init
   git submodule update

The code is developed and tested under modern Linux. It is also
compiled from time to time under OS X but is not tested there.

Compiling
=========
Clone git repository, initialize submodules and the run make.

   git clone git://github.com/gfto/tsdecrypt.git
   git submodule init
   git submodule update
   make
   make install

Examples
========
To get a quick start here are some example command lines. The default
CA system is set to CONAX, you can change it using --ca-system parameter,
see man page or program help for more options.

Examples:

   # Decrypt multicast stream from 239.0.50.11:5000 using 10.0.1.1:2233
   # as camd server and output decrypted result to 239.78.78.78:5000
   tsdecrypt --camd-server 10.0.1.1 \
       --input 239.0.50.11:5000 --output 239.78.78.78:5000

   # Same as above but enable EMM processing
   tsdecrypt --emm --camd-server 10.0.1.1:2233 \
       --input 239.0.50.11:5000 --output 239.78.78.78:5000

   # Same as above but do not filter output stream thus allowing
   # EIT/TOT/NIT, etc tables to passthrough
   tsdecrypt --output-filter --emm -camd-server 10.0.1.1 \
       --input 239.0.50.11:5000 --output 239.78.78.78:5000

   # Read stream over RTP and process VIACCESS encoded channel
   tsdecrypt --ca-system VIACCESS --emm --camd-server 10.0.1.1:2233 \
       --input-rtp --input 239.0.50.11:5000 --output 239.78.78.78:5000


OSCAM configuration
===================
In order for tsdecrypt to communicate with OSCAM, OSCAM must have user
added in oscam.user file and cs378x protocol must be enabled.

Example oscam.user file:
[account]
user     = user
pwd      = pass
group    = 1
au       = 1
uniq     = 0
monlevel = 4

Example part of oscam.conf file:
[cs378x]
port    = 2233
