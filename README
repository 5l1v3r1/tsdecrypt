tsdecrypt
=========
tsdecrypt reads decrypts incoming mpeg transport stream over UDP/RTP and
then decrypts it using libdvbcsa and keys obtained from OSCAM or similar cam
server. Currently supported and tested cryptosystems are Conax, Cryptoworks
and Irdeto. tsdecrypt communicates with camd using camd35 over tcp protocol
also known as cs378x.

Installation
============
tsdecrypt depends on two two external libraries - openssl and libdvbcsa.
You probably already have openssl installed, libdvbcsa can be downloaded
from http://www.videolan.org/developers/libdvbcsa.html

Documentation
=============
tsdecrypt is controlled using command line parameters. Run tsdecrypt to
see all of the parameters and explanation what every one of them does.

Development
===========
The development is tracked using git. The repository is hosted at github
to get it, run the following command:

   git clone git://github.com/gfto/libtsfuncs.git
   git submodule init
   git submodule update

Compiling
=========
Clone git repository, initialize submodules and the run make.

   git clone git://github.com/gfto/tsdecrypt.git
   git submodule init
   git submodule update
   make

Examples
========
To get a quick start here are some example command lines (the default
CA is set to CONAX, you can change it using -c CONAX|CRYPTOWORK|IRDETO):

   # Decrypt multicast stream from 239.0.50.11:5000 using 10.0.1.1:2233
   # as camd server and output decrypted result to 239.78.78.78:5000
   tsdecrypt -s 10.0.1.1 -I 239.0.50.11:5000 -O 239.78.78.78:5000

   # Same as above but enable EMM processing (-e)
   tsdecrypt -e -s 10.0.1.1 -I 239.0.50.11:5000 -O 239.78.78.78:5000

   # Same as above but do not filter output stream (-p) thus allowing
   # EIT/TOT/NIT, etc tables to passthrough
   tsdecrypt -p -e -s 10.0.1.1 -I 239.0.50.11:5000 -O 239.78.78.78:5000

OSCAM configuration
===================
In order for tsdecrypt to communicate with OSCAM, OSCAM must have user
added in oscam.user file and cs378x protocol must be enabled.

Example oscam.user file:
[account]
user     = user
pwd      = pass
group    = 1
au       = 1
uniq     = 0
monlevel = 4

Example part of oscam.conf file:
[cs378x]
port    = 2233
